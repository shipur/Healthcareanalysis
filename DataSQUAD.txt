Projection Description Outline:

By leveraging datasets availible through census.gov and heatlcare.gov, we will create
visualizations comparing Average Household Income and Average Healthcare Cost.
As an additional dimension, we will view Obamacare enrollment and its effect on healthcare costs.
The assumption is that with more people enrolled in obamacare, healthcare costs as a whole will decrease.

Research Questions:

1. Do states with higher average income have higher average healthcare costs?
2. Has the introduction obamacare had an effect on healthcare costs?
3. Can we project where healthcare costs are going?


We will leverage data from 2005-2015.

Databases that will be used:
HealthData.gov
Census.gov

Rough Breakdown of tasks:
1. Compare healthcare cost vs average income
2. Compare uninsured rates from 2005 - 2015 and the introduction of obamacare
3. Compare healthcare costs Insured Vs ACA Marketplace costs
4. Compare Medicare/Medicaid Utilization since the introduction of Obamacare
